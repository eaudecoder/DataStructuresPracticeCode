# DataStructuresPracticeCode
Different problems in data structures. Great for students who are looking for resources in dsa and currently studying in college pursuing computer science. All code is done in C as regular college syllabus. 


This is a great way to learn if you are someone who gets scrambled when they see some big blocks of code. You not only learn to deal with code heavy problems, but you learn how to break down complex or seemingly complex problems into small bits and then solve them using the simplest ways someone can imagine.

This is great for students who want to learn more about sorting algorithms, but get stuck because there are just so many of them, and 
they usually get distracted in the process of googling and researching about them. Everything is in one place, think of this as your ultimate study lab where you get the simpler forms of code, so that you can prepare for whatever exam you are aiming for, or be good in sa in general.
